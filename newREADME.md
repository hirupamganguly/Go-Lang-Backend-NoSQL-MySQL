## Why go lang?

Backend development languages handle the ‘behind-the-scenes’ functionality of an applications. It’s code that connects the application to a database, manages user connections, and powers the application itself. Backend developers typically earn higher salaries than front-end developers, as backend languages tend to be more technical.

Python: the most-loved programming language and The First suggestion for backend development in 2021.
Python is capable of unleashing its full potential when used in web development, machine learning, and fintech. Moreover, thanks to its scalability, it also proves to be popular among startups. You can check a whole range of Python’s applications in our extensive guide on what's it used for. So as you can see, regardless of whether you’re looking to build a large or small digital product, chances are, you’ll find a relevant Python framework and a knowledgeable team pretty fast.

The second suggestion for backend development in 2021 is a statically typed, compiling programming language: Go, also known as Golang. Released in 2009, it has been named the Programming Language of the Year by TIOBE twice so far and – while it’s surely less popular than the above-mentioned Python – it’s been mentioned as the fifth most loved technology by 62.3% of the Stack Overflow survey’s respondents in 2020. If you want to develop faster, perhaps because you have many different services to write, or you have a large team of developers, then Go is your language of choice.
Golang performs on average 40 times better than Python when making the same calculations. 
Python’s response time is longer. In the same timeframe (1 minute), we're able to handle even 10500 requests in Go, whereas in Python we arrive at as much as  2000 requests fewer. 

Rust and Go are both awesome
Go is fast, but Rust is faster.
Go has an efficient garbage collector, but Rust has static memory management.
Go has great concurrency support, but Rust has provably-correct concurrency.
Go has interfaces, but Rust has traits and other zero-cost abstractions.
You can also use Rust to develop a web API, but it wasn’t designed with this use case in mind. Rust’s focus on memory-safety increases complexity and development time, especially for a fairly simple web API. Programming languages that support concurrency better help you to build parallel systems. Concurrency reduces the idle time of a computer system, therefore, languages that support concurrency are popular. Go supports concurrency better than Rust. Your chances of successfully building parallel systems improve if you use Go. Go is easy to understand and use. Rust has more powerful features, which also increases its complexity. Go is an easy-to-use language, therefore, you can develop apps faster with it. On the other hand, the complexities of Rust can slow down the development. Rust has more powerful features than Go. You can achieve more with Rust while coding less.

The Third suggestion for backend development in 2021 is Kotlin

The Fourth suggestion for backend development in 2021 is NodeJS

Justin O'Brien from Competitive team on Valorent! said that the entire backend microservice architecture is built using Golang. This means that everything from spinning up and managing a game server process to purchasing items is all done using services written in golang.
